# <font color="#8cd000">Evidence-informed school practice {{< fa school >}}</font>{.cent1}

::: notes

- let's start with the concept evidence-informed school practice

:::

## <font color="#8cd000">Evidence-informed school practice {{< fa school >}}</font>

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
* Teachers can draw on different information sources when making professional decisions; information sources range from anecdotal evidence to scientific evidence (e.g., Buehl & Fives, 2009)

* [Evidence-informed school practice means to consider, among others, scientific evidence in professional actions to e.g., solve problems that repeatedly emerge]{.imp2}
<br>
  &rarr; Increasing school quality, teaching quality and students' achievement <br> (e.g., Brown et al., 2017)
<br>

* However, teachers often do not consider scientific evidence in their school practice (e.g., Brown et al., 2017; Hinzke et al., 2020)

:::

::: notes

- different definitions, but what most of these definitions have in common is that teachers are encouraged to consider scientific findings in their professional actions
- despite this widespread demand, teachers often do not act in an evidence-informed manner
:::


## <font color="#8cd000">Evidence-informed school practice {{< fa school >}}</font>

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
Numerous barriers exist that make it difficult for teachers to act in an evidence-informed manner:

::: {.incremental}
  * Resources (e.g., limited time)
  * Belief systems (e.g., negative beliefs about the practical applicability of scientific knowledge)
  * Cognitive abilities / competencies (e.g., lack of statistical knowledge) <br>
  (e.g., Brown et al., 2022; van Schaik et al., 2018)
:::

:::

::: notes
- question arises: what are the barriers that prevent teachers from doing so?
- previous research has identified numerous barriers such as
  - resources like limited time
  - belief systems
  - cognitive abilities/competencies

* [__Cognitive abilities / competencies (e.g., lack of statistical knowledge)__]{.imp2}<br>
  (e.g., Brown et al., 2022; van Schaik et al., 2018)
:::

::: notes

- If we now specifically look at the abbilities/competencies, teachers often struggle with interpreting and understanding scientific information as well as evaluating its veracity i.e., to evaluate the appropriateness of the study design, for example.  
  - firsthand evaluation 

- another way is to evaluate whether the information appears trustworthy

:::
  

# <font color="#8cd000">Trust in scientific evidence {{< fa hands-helping >}}</font> {.cent1}

::: notes

I will elaborate on this in more detail
:::

## <font color="#8cd000">Trust in scientific evidence {{< fa hands-helping >}}</font>

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
* [Teachers often evaluate scientific evidence secondhand: instead of evaluating its veracity, they evaluate its credibility and trustworthiness]{.imp2} (e.g., Merk & Rosman, 2019)
<br> &rarr; Trust = key predictor/indicator to what extent scientific evidence is positively evaluated and considered (Bromme et al.,2022; Hendriks et al., 2016)
<br>

* Subjective criteria such as teachers' beliefs can influence the evaluation of trust (e.g., Dietz & Den Hartong, 2006; Blöbaum, 2016)

:::

::: notes

- if we evaluate the extent to which an information, e.g., scientific evidence, appears trustworthy, we conduct what is known as secondhand evaluation
  - hence, teachers do not ask to what extent the statement is correct - that would be firsthand evaluation - but to what extent they can trust the statement 

- since teachers often choose this secondhand evaluation, trust can be a central predictor/indicator for the extent to which teachers actually consider scientific evidence in their school practice

- furthermore, the evaluation of trust can be influenced by teachers' belief systems
  - now I am going to present two of such possible influencing factors in more detail

::: 

## <font color="#8cd000">Trust in different information sources {{< fa list >}}</font>

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[(Future) teachers primarily consider anecdotal evidence in their practice (e.g., Buehl & Fives, 2009) and have more trust in other teachers than in scientists:]{.imp2}

* Especially when looking for practical advice (Hendriks et al., 2021)
* Educational scientists = "smart but evil" (Merk & Rosman, 2019)
* Lack of integrity and benevolence as reasons for distrust in educational scientists (Rosman & Merk, 2021)

:::

::: notes

- findings from previous studies exist on how teachers trust different information sources
- we know that teachers primarily consider anecdotal evidence - own teaching experience, advice from colleagues - in their practice and also trust information from teachers more than information from scientists.

:::

::: notes

- Problematic in the sense that anecdotal evidence that is not supported by science - think, for example, of common misconceptions such as learning styles - is consequently disseminated in everyday school life
- This (can) lead(s) to ineffective or dysfunctional practice

:::

## <font color="#8cd000">Trust and confirmation bias {{< fa eye-slash >}}</font>

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[Confirmation bias = own prior beliefs influence searching and interpreting information]{.imp2}

* Information that is consistent with prior beliefs is preferred or perceived as more confirmatory
* Information that is inconsistent with prior beliefs is more quickly devalued and thus avoided or questioned and scanned to find errors in it <br> (e.g., Hart et al., 2009; Nickerson, 1998; Stroud, 2017)
<br>
<br>

:::

::: notes

- confirmation bias means that one's own prior beliefs influence the search for and interpretation of information
  - in the sense that 
    - information that is in line with one's own prior beliefs is preferred
    - whereas information that contradicts one's own beliefs is devalued
  
:::

## <font color="#8cd000">Trust and confirmation bias {{< fa eye-slash >}}</font>

:::{style="font-size: 0.8em"}
[In the educational context, confirmation bias is hardly systematically researched:]{.imp2}

* Teachers often do not look for data that challenge/question their own opinions (Van Lommel et al., 2017)
* When data is inconsistent with teachers' beliefs, teachers look for explanations as to why the data might be wrong (Andersen, 2020)
* Student teachers are more likely to display confirmation bias than hindsight bias when evaluating scientific studies (Masnick & Zimmermann, 2009)

:::

::: notes

- confirmation bias is often discussed as a barrier of evidence-informed practice, but it has not yet been systematically analyzed
- there are initial insights on the existence of Confirmation Bias in databased decision making based on qualitative analyses
- but to the best of our knowledge only one quantitative study exists that focus on interpreting scientific evidence
- the study shows that teachers rather show a confirmation bias than a hindsight bias when evaluating scientific studies 
  - firsthand evaluation 
- thus, we wanted to investigate whether secondhand evaluation, or more precisely the trust in scientific statements, is also influenced by confirmation bias

:::


::: notes

- if this is the case, this could be a further barrier for evidence-informed practice
- if teachers demonstrate a selective trust in scientific evidence, then this can lead to a one-sided or lack of reference to evidence. This would make it difficult or even impossible to adequately realize evidence-informed practice

IF TIME IS ENOUGH ADD AN EXAMPLE
::: 

# <font color="#8cd000">Experimental study - teachers' beliefs and their influence on trust {{< fa search >}} </font> {.cent1}

::: notes

- in our experimental study we have focused on both explained aspects
  - the source of evidence as well as teachers' prior beliefs about an educational topic

:::

## <font color="#8cd000">Hypotheses {{< fa exclamation >}} </font>

<br>

H<sub>1</sub>: When teachers are confronted with knowledge claims regarding specific topics from educational science, they show more trust in claims if these are allegedly from another teacher (anecdotal evidence) than from a scientific study (scientific evidence).

<br>

H<sub>2</sub>: When teachers are confronted with evidence for specific knowledge claims of educational science, they show more trust in these claims if these are belief-consistent.


::: notes

- examined:

1) whether teachers show more trust in certain claims from educational science when they come from a teacher (that is anecdotal evidence) than from a scientist/scientific study (that is scientific evidence)
2) whether teachers trust certain claims from educational science more when they fit their prior beliefs - rather than refute them

<center> [*N* = 414 teachers in Germany]{.imp} </center>


* 73.1 % female teachers
<br>
<br>
* 80.8 % of the teachers are between 30 and 59 years old

- we collected data from a representative sample of 414 teachers in Germany
- here you can see some information about the demographics of our sample

![(cf. Schmidt et al., 2022)](images/epitomes.png){width="250"}

::: notes

- to test our hypotheses we presented the teachers with in total two different claims from educational science
  - these two claims were randomly chosen out of four claims 
  - randomized was also the order whether the claim was made by a teacher or a scientist and 
  - whether the claim was consistent or inconsistent to the participants prior topic-specific beliefs
- the procedure was always the same
  - first we presented the teachers with the topic, i.g.e, integration of figures and text
  - then we asked the participants for their opinion on this topic
  - afterwards we showed them the respective claim - in this box -
  - this claim was either consistent or inconsistent to the answer given before
  - finally, the participants were ask how much they trust the claim above 
  
- let's have a look at the results

![Schmidt et al. (2022; p. 8)](images/trust_by_belief-consistency_source_topic.jpg)


::: notes

- in this figure you can see the trust ratings differentiated per consistency on the left y-axis, per topic on the right y-axis and source left column scientific evidence, right column anecdotal evidence
- what is quite obvious when we look at bouth source columms is that the average trust ratings for scientific evidence are higher than for anecdotal evidence
  - acroos all topics - which is quite surprising
- we can also see that teachers trust claims more if they fit their beliefs, i.e., when they are consistent with their beliefs

![](images/table_results.png){width="250"}

::: notes 

looking at the inferential statistics, I brought different Bayesian multi level models
- today only Model 2 and Model 5 are important
  - Model 2 focuses on the different sources (scientific vs. anecdotal evidence)
  - Model 5 focuses on the influence of Confirmation Bias
- I do not want to explain the results in detail, but what we can see is that our descriptive impression is also supported inferentially. 
- We have strong evidence for both results --> ÜBERPRÜFEN

[{{< fa surprise >}}: In contrast to previous studies, teachers at hand showed greater trust in scientific evidence than in anecdotal evidence]{.imp2} <br>

* Trust in specific statements vs. trust in sources without content statements
* Influence of publication outlet (scientific journal vs. teacher blog) <br> &rarr; Information from social media is rated less trustworthy compared to scientific and anecdotal evidence (Braten & Ferguson, 2015)
<br>


[{{< fa check-double >}}: Consistent with previous studies, teachers at hand show strong confirmation bias]{.imp2} 
<br> &rarr; Selective trust could lead to one-sided use of scientific evidence
<br>
<br>

[{{< fa bolt >}}: In the present study trust, not engagement with or use of evidence, was measured]{.imp2}
:::

::: notes

- first, take a closer look at the surprising result that teachers in our study showed greater trust in scientific than in anecdotal evidence
- two possible explanations could be due to the operationalization of the independent variable (source)
  - we have analyzed trust in specific statements to increase internal validity 
  - previous studies have analyzed trust in sources without using a content statement, i.e. only asking how much they trust statements from, for example, scientists
  - this may have led to a bias in that different sources may be associated with different topics/expertise. For example, teachers as teaching experts and scientists as experts in conducting scientific studies, i.e., practical vs. more abstract topics.
  - publication outlet might have confounded the results as we described journal vs. teacher blog
  - study by Braten & Ferguson showed that social media is rated less trustworthy. Hence, the publication outlet 'teacher blog' may have lead to lower trust ratings of anecdotal evidence 
  - we have chosen a written format for both sources to keep them as parallal as possible 

- consistent with previous research is our result on confirmation bias 
- the results show that confirmation bias can also lead to selective trust

- taking both results togehter, one could argue that it is not a general lack of trust in science that prevents teachers from considering scientific evidence in their school practice, rather a selective choice of evidence is problematic for an adequate realization of evidence-informed practice
- In this regard, I finally want to highlight that we have only analyzed trust as a key predictor for the engagement with evidence
  - we did not directly measure engagement with or use of evidence 
  - important step for future studies
